## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

The 1st instruction being executed is "ljmp $0xf000,$0xe05b".

>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?

At 0xffff0.




#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

Firstly it sets up segement registers and stack, then initializes ports, using **BIOS interrupt 13 with AH=0x0** **_[INITIALIZE PORT]_**. Then, configuring disk number in **DL** and sector number in **EBX**, it uses **interrupt 14 with AH=0x42** **_[EXTENDED READ]_** to read the sector.

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

Firstly, checking the return of INTR14, if BIOS failed to read disk then the finding failed, too. 

Secondly, checking if there is a MBR signature in the sector, if not the disk is not bootable, going to the next disk.

Then, it starts to check partitions on the disk. Checking if a partition is unused, kernel partition and bootable partition. If one of these failed, bootloader will go to next partition, until it find a bootable kerbel partition. This process is in a finite loop.

If a partition is found, bootloader starts to load the kernel.

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

It will use INPR18, notifying BIOS a failed boot, and print an infomation.

>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

After found a kernel, bootloader will use BIOS to load it to memory, then through reading the start address in ELF header, it calculates out a 16:16 address, saves it on memory, and indirectly jump to it (since 8086 has no instruction for directly jumping by 16:16 address).

#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?

0x0

>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,

>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?

0xc0023114 in palloc_get_page(flags=(PAL_ASSERT | PAL_ZERO))

0xc00203aa in paging_init()

0xc002031b in pintos_init()

0xc002013d in start() 

>> B8.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?

(void *) 0xc0101000

>> B8.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?

0x0



>B9: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B9.1 what does the call stack look like?

0xc0023114 in palloc_get_page(flags=PAL_ZERO)

0xc0020a81 in thread_create(name=0xc002e895 "idle", priority=0, function=0xc0020eb0 <idle>, aux=0xc000efbc)

0xc0020976 in thread_start()

0xc0020334 in pintos_start()

0xc002013d in start()

>> B9.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?

(void *) 0xc0103000

>> B9.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?

0x102027


## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.

To write a shell, I need use functions for IO. So I read code in `init.c`, `input.c` and `console.c`. I noticed `console.c` provides `puts()`, `putbuf()`, `putchar()` and `input.c` provides `input_getc()` which receive keyboard input. I used them. I also find `strcmp()` in `lib/string.h` so I used it for parsing cmdline.

I used infinite loop for running shell. I set up a buffer for cmdline. I read from keyboard char by char. I implemented backspace by using buffer and "\b \b".
